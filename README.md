# practice
just writing scripts for fun!
If anyone does read these and has any tips to make the code more effient let me know!

Some features to add include

each team has their own text. {Fin}
  E.i team blue with Always be all cap, bold, and blue
  team red with as well be all red, cap, and bold, 
  team pink and yellow will follow the same pattern
  
there will a pause in the code to wait for user feedback in order to continue processing code.{Fin}

a way to verify the user has entered the correct format for birthday. {Fin}

I would like to figure out how to tell my main folder which files to access next. So  I can have a log in screen that\
checks for new users, create a profile for new users, and pulls up profiles for existing users.
